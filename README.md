This app will do the following:

1. Find your current location using CoreLocation    
* Find nearest frequented shops and list them in order from nearest to furthest relative to your location.  
*   Uses Foursquare API to get the following information:
	* Store icon  
	* Store name  
	* distance in miles from your current location to the store  
	* Store category. (ie. food, clothing, museum, etc..)  
	* Open/Closed status  
* clicking on the store will take you to a map view.

All information (except icon) is cached so you are still able to see the information if disconnected from the internet.
